Exercises based on the examples that we learn at class - you can solve this using the notes in this directory.

Week2: Read your plink frequency output file in R and compute expected genotype frequencies per SNP in a present-day population that you select [basic]. 

Week 2: Compute deviation from HWE by comparing expected genotype frequency for a SNP that you select vs observed genotype frequency [if you are familiar with R].
