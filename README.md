### **SYLLABUS:**

**Week-1**  **Genome, sequencing and sequencing data - studying genetic variation**

**Aim:** Learning about the sequencing data, data formats, programs, softwares, tools to prepare genomic datasets for population genetics analyses

**Hands-on:** Examining the file formats, small edits on eigenstrat and plink files, conversion of file formats to each other using [convertf](https://github.com/DReichLab/AdmixTools/blob/master/convertf/README), becoming familiar with [Plink](https://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/index.shtml)

**Week-2** **Allele and genotype frequencies**

**Aim:** Learning about basic population genetics concepts, allele and genotype frequencies, HWE, 

**Hands-on:** Preparing a toy dataset using [pileupCaller](https://github.com/stschiff/sequenceTools), computing allele frequencies and measuring the HWE using [Plink](https://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/index.shtml) and R

**Reading suggestions:** Nielsen and Slatkin 2013 An Introduction to Population Genetics Chapter 1

**Week-3** **Genetic drift, mutation and studying the shared evolutionary history of populations**

**Aim:** Understanding genetic drift. Studying the relationships (allele frequency correlations) between populations: Introduction to F-statistics.

**Hands-on:** Becoming familiar with the AdmixTools, running F-statistics

**Reading suggestions:** Nielsen and Slatkin, 2013, Chapter 2; Peter B, 2016, doi:10.1534/genetics.115.183913

**Week-4**  **Discovery analyses - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

**Aim:** Understanding the PCA, running a simple PCA

**Hands-on:** Running _smartpca_ tool of AdmixTools for PCA and plotting the results in R.
